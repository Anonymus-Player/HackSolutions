# HackySTL

This was a repo for hacky examples, but because more STL classes appeared it was transformed
into a stdlib implementation for C++ primarly, but we don't descourage implentation for STL 
in other langs (please note you have to use the apropriate directory for the lang in which
you want to implement for). 
The Idea came from another [project](https://github.com/LegatAbyssWalker/amazingCode) 

# Goal:
  To implement every single item from stdlib, you can however implement things that are not standard
  in a non-standard way, like: DefaultArg, `get` inside `tuple` or compile-time `for` loops
